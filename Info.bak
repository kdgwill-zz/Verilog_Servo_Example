R/C Servos are controlled by sending them a "pulse" of variable width. 
The parameters for this pulse are that it has a minimum width, a maximum width, and a repetition rate. 
These values are not "standard" but there are conventions that are generally accepted. 
The convention is that a pulse of approximately 1500 uS (1.5 mS) is the "neutral" point for the servo. 
Given the rotation constraints of the servo, neutral is defined to be the position where the servo has 
exactly the same amount of potential rotation in the counter clockwise direction as it does in the clockwise direction. 
It is important to note that different R/C servos will have different constraints on their rotation but they _all_ have 
a neutral position, and that position is always around 1500 uS.

Standard width of the pulse should be between 1000 and 2000µs, with 1500µs representing the center position. 
This equivalates to 1ms 2ms and 1.5ms

These servos are "active" devices, meaning that when commanded to move they will actively hold their position. 
Thus, if a servo is commanded to the neutral position and an external force is present to push against the servo 
(presumably through the mechanical linkage) the servo will actively resist being moved out of that position. 
The maximum amount of force the servo can exert is the torque rating of the servo. The Futaba servo is rated around 
40 oz/inches or 2.5 pounds of push at 1 inch away from from the shaft of the servo motor. 
Servos will not hold their position forever though, the position pulse must be repeated to instruct the servo to stay in position.
The maximum amount of time that can pass before the servo will stop holding its position is the command repetition rate. 
Typical values for the command repetition rate are 20 - 30 mS. You can repeat the pulse more often than this, but not less often.
When this timeout expires and there hasn't been another pulse the servo de-energizes the motor. 
In this state in can be pushed out of position and it will not return to the commanded position.

When the pulse sent to a servo is less than 1500 uS. 
the servo positions and holds its output shaft some number of degrees counterclockwise from the neutral point. 
When the pulse is wider than 1500 uS the opposite occurs. 
The minimal width and the maximum width of pulse that will command the servo to turn to a valid position are 
functions of each servo. Different brands, and even different servos of the same brand, will have different 
maximum and minimums. Generally the minimum pulse will be about 1000 uS wide and the maximum pulse will be 2000uS wide. 
However, these are just guidelines and should be checked on the servos you use. In particular if you attempt to command 
a servo past its maximum or minimum rotation it will use the maximum amount of current trying unsuccessfully to achieve 
that position.

Another parameter that varies from servo to servo is the slew rate. 
This is the time it takes for the servo to change from one position to another. 
The worst case slewing time is when the servo is holding at the minimum rotation and 
it is commanded to go to maximum rotation. This can take several seconds on very high torque servos. 
Typically it takes less than two seconds.
